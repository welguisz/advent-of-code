# Advent of Code

## Overview
After completing all puzzles, I am going through my repo and trying to clean it 
up to make it more readable. As I go through it, I will be updating my thoughts
and put the general solution in this repository. During the actual event, I will
not update the current year's solution thoughts until January of the next year 
(e.g. Advent of Code 2022 README's will not be available until January 2023 at 
the earliest.)
