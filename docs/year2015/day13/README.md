# Day 13: Knights of the Dinner Table

[Back to Top README file](../../../README.md)
## Overview
Difficult Level: Easy

Input: List of String with people and their happiness when seated next to certain people.

This puzzle is very similar to [All in a Single Night](../day09/README.md). The only
difference is in Part 2, you add a new guest that adds 0 instead of trying to find
the minimum value.
